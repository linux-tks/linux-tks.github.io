title: About Linux-TKS

## What is Linux-TKS?

TKS is a recursive acronym for "TKS Keeps Secrets". It is usually pronounced
the same as "ticks".

Linux-TKS is a freedesktop.org Secrets API implementation for Linux. It aims
to offer this implementation in a way agnostic to the desktop environment. It
uses minimal dependencies and is written in Rust. It is typically used as a
user-level systemd service.

## How can I use it?

Please follow the [installation instructions](/install.html) to install Linux-TKS.

## Why should I use it?

TKS has a few advantages over other secrets implementations:
* It is designed to be desktop agnostic. It should work with any desktop
  environment, or even without a desktop environment. I personally use it with
  the i3 window manager.
* It implements the freedesktop.org Secrets API, which is a standard for
  secrets management on Linux. This means that it should work with any
  application that uses this API.
